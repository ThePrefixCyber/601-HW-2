# Unit Test
With my manual unit test, I found the everything works except for the image upload.  
I tested the message sending, sign-in/out, and the navigation buttons: Home/Resume/Chat.

MonkeyTest found some problem with my sign-in button, but it seems to work properly.  
I couldn't figure out how to make the error go away.  The only other complaint was
that my page title, "Chat" is too short.
